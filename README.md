# Cu-urls : All your social links at one place !

Want to quickly send any of your personal information like your number,email,github profile link or any other link , <strong>Cu-urls</strong> is the quick way.

Just launch the app for the first time , add in all the information that you need frequently .
Next time you want to send someone any of the data , just fire up the app and copy whatever data you need to send and you are good to go .

This app does not store any of your data in the cloud or any other database . It stores all your personal information on <strong>your device</strong> itself using Shared Preferences.</br>
